					<div class="lg-col lg-col-9">

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue emphasis">Come on, Slowpoke.”</span> Dolores reaches out her hand to help Orville up off the beach. He accepts. Then, sliding his cold hand around her neck, they kiss, and it feels not only romantic, but important.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Okay,”</span> he says, grabbing her hands. <span class="dialogue">“Tell me what we're doing.”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Windows,”</span> she answers.  <span class="dialogue">“What do yah wanna bet they left a window unlocked all winter?”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What?”</span> He asks, challenging, pressing. <span class="dialogue">“Breaking and entering?”</span>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">But Dolores's already skipping forward. <span class="dialogue">“Rich, old fucks own these houses,”</span> she explains, <span class="dialogue">“and they all fly south for the winter. Summer doesn't start for what, a month?”</span> She makes her breath deliberate. <span class="dialogue">“See, you can see your breath. No way they're back yet; it's too cold.”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The first window she tries is locked, the second also.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Dor, let's give up,”</span> Orville offers, feigning disappointment, putting his hand consolingly to her back. <span class="dialogue">“Maybe this just wasn't a good idea.”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">When a window budges, he swallows his words.</p>
						
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Told ya,”</span> Dolores giggles, spinning like an excited actress to hug him. <span class="dialogue">“It’s froze still. Here, you try.”</span> Orville steps back and purses his lips, careful of her eyes.</p>
						
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">I’m not so sure—”</span> he says. She crosses her arms, pouting.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What’re you, pussy?”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A second later he is trying to be manly, wrestling with the window himself, grunting. The cold pane shatters angrily, the noise muted by the dense night.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores claps and places her hand on his pants. <span class="dialogue">“Oh yeah,”</span> she coos. <span class="dialogue">“Climb in!”</span> She steps past him and ducks into the silent house.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville has no time to think, shocked, dusty evidence of his first crime on his jacket, shards piled on his shoes.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Be careful, still sharp,</span>” she warns. Without a choice, Orville follows.</p>

						<!--This is a break in the flash-->
						<p class="px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">It isn't much warmer inside, and darker.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I have cat-eyes,”</span>Dolores whispers, taking the lead, entangling her fingers with his. <span class="dialogue">“First let's find the bastards' liquor cabinet. Don't turn on the lights.”</span>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Hairs on the back of Orville's neck stand at attention. He picks his cuticles, bumps into a dresser.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She opens a door and leads Orville down a short hallway, turning right and up a staircase to a landing that serves as a mud-room.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A second set of stairs brings them to the main floor. Paintings of sinking ships and lonely lighthouses ornament the walls. Above the ships are hung heads of exotic game with spectacular racks, horns and angry teeth. A large bay window overlooks the beach. The cold moonlight casts a yellow glare into the beasts’ glassy eyes, giving them life.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores spots the liquor cabinet next to the mantel. <span class="dialogue">“Bingo,”</span> she whispers, letting go Orville's hand.</p> 
						
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He removes his shoes. <span class="thought-dialogue">Who can resist the feeling of carpet shag?</span> He sits in a recliner by the window and is reminded of his childhood fear of ghosts. Taking a deep breath, removing his jacket, he feels lightheaded, hypnotized.</p>


						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The cupboard clanks. <span class="dialogue">“Eureka!”</span> Dolores trumpets, no longer nervous.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She is saddling onto Orville's lap, unscrewing the cap off a bottle. <span class="dialogue">“Buffalo Chase. Not bad—not bad at all,”</span> she toasts, taking a first pull then passing it to Orville. He sips, but winces.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Strong!”</span> he groans.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores grins, then kisses him, her tongue getting right to business.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Come on,”</span>she encourages, standing up and capping the whiskey. <span class="dialogue">“Let's find a bed.”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She tries one door off the kitchen leading to a bathroom. No good.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A second door guards a staircase up.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">They take the steps two at a time.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">At the top, they find an alleyway of empty space, white carpet stretching to a king-size bed.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Two lovers clamber over. Pause, plop. Kissing hard, rolling and wrestling, pinning each other, panting, pausing only to guzzle from their bottle.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores gnaws at Orville's collarbone, her tongue on his ears and neck.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Bra strap blunders with belts following suit.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Before long, hands grab at clothing like lion cubs preying.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Shoes, socks, shirts, pants, panties, bra and briefs, all destined by the heat of the moment to the corners of the carpet.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Scratching, biting, and repetition.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Young birds free-falling in a shared moment of exploratory necessity.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A moment caught up in.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">All worry melting off their bodies, while they find in each other something thought lost.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The lake: powerful and relentless, forever deep, blue, frigid at best, beautiful, but dangerous, consistent and reliable, such flatness on a calm day, but not something to trifle with. Like the moor not taut, even if thought secure, ending in a ship being thrashed over night.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">His dream is of her asking for it to last forever, him telling her it won’t.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The next thing they know, light is pouring in from the rising sun. Their still naked bodies roll and groan in response and dissent, but smile at each other and kiss.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Morning breath.</p>

						<!--This is a break in the flash-->
						<p class="px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville, wearing only underwear, idles in the kitchen where a coffee pot hiccups and hums. He yawns complacently, relaxed.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The empty lake house soothes him. The beasts, before terrifying, mocking, now rightly appear dead, empty shells of playthings.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She was right. <span class="thought-dialogue">Nothing went wrong.</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores's in the bathroom. The door's cracked.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The coffee's ready.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Hey, grab me a cup?”</span> she asks, explaining, <span class="dialogue">“It might be awhile.”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He pours into her mug, adding a dash of Bailey's before picking up the mug, shuffling to the toilet, handing it to her and sneaking a peek in the process.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I feel horrible,”</span> Dolores says.</p>
	
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“The whiskey?”</span> Orville asks.</p>
						
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“If I hadn't drank so much—”</span> she explains. She sips her coffee. <span class="dialogue">“Mmm, what's in this?”</span></p>
	
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Irish Cream.”</span></p>
						
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Mmm.”</span> she repeats, laughs, <span class="dialogue">“—hope it helps! How do you feel?”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville sips from his mug. He has no headache. He hadn't drunk nearly as much as her.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Horrible”</span> he lies, <span class="dialogue">“that makes both of us.”</span></p>

					 	<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">On the counter, he finds a copy of last-November's Rackle Times. The headline reads: Boy Falls Off Pier, Drowns. Underneath it says: Suicide By Boy's Mother, Same Day.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“At least I’ll always have you, Dor,”</span> he says under his breath.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What?”</span> she asks.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I said, I love you. That’s all.”</span>Orville says.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She flushes the toilet.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“There's something I've been meaning to talk to you about,”</span> she broaches, walking out of the bathroom and grabbing him around the waist. He holds her to his chest, and they kiss. <span class="dialogue">“I'm pregnant,”</span> she says.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville loosens his grip on her.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She clings at him, needs him.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He straightens his back, stiffens his muscles, stares at the lake.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She bites the skin on the inside of her mouth.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He moves away from her, thinking and walking and thinking in circles.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She’s crying, gasping.</p>

						
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">On the other side of the house, a doorknob jiggles, jiggles.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Chills streak through their bodies.</p>
	
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What was that?”</span> she whimpers.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“We gotta go!”</span> he whispers immediately. <span class="dialogue">“Hurry.”</span></p> 
	
						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What about our—?”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Fuck everything. We gotta get outa here.”</span></p>

						<!--This is a break in the flash-->
						<p class="px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">They're rushing out the lakeside patio-door.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He's in only briefs, her only panties.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Both topless. Both racing, boobs bouncing.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Tears stunted by adrenaline.</p> 

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A cluster-fuck, barefoot hopscotch a quarter mile down the rocky beach to the car.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville scans behind his back: Two blobs are pointing and calling, but moving slowly.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">When in the car, he realizes the keys are in his coat back at the house, and he slams his head on the steering-wheel. <span class="dialogue">“Just fucking great,”</span> he says.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores's whimpering, using her hands to cover her body. She demands to know. <span class="dialogue">“Do you still love me?”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Come on, Dor. Get your head on straight. What're we gonna do?”</span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“You mean, what am <span class="emphasis">I</span> going to do?”</span> she rebuttals, now less sad than angry. <span class="dialogue">“Did you not even hear me? I'm <span class="emphasis">pregnant!”</span></span></p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He isn't paying attention to her, instead watching the steady progress of their pursuers, a pair of brittle-boned snow birds, a man and a woman, both lumbering forward as fast as possible but with deliberate strides, their poor, fleshy, saggy bodies on the verge of breaking. All it takes is one misstep, then either extended darkness or hospital fluorescence.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Orville!”</span> Dolores berates.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">In the pause, the sound of the waves, pushing, pulling.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Should we run?”</span> Orville asks. <span class="dialogue">“What do you think? Help me think, Dolores. Please. Not everything can always be about <span class="emphasis">you.</span></span>” His tone is acid, calculated.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores slams back into her car seat, stone-faced, frozen, staring forward. Her hand flips open the glove box, grabs and passes Orville the spare key he didn't know about. She crosses her arms and begins to weep, quietly heartbroken.</p>

						<p class="px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He puts the car in first, and like birds of the snow, off they fly south.</p>
