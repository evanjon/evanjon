					<div class="lg-col lg-col-9">
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Hidden on a grassy mattress in the middle of a field of golden prairie grass, Dolores Dandy and Roland Atter are having sex.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">To him, the sex is romantic. To her, desperate.</p> 
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He isn't wearing a condom, but it doesn't matter because she's already pregnant. The baby's not his.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">At the exact same moment, a letter, addressed in black, inky cursive, is sitting unopened in Dolores's mailbox.  That letter follows verbatim:</p>

						<div class="col-10 mx-auto dialogue py1">
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Listen to me. Let me take it all back; I love you.</p>

							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">What had gotten into me, I'll never know. I was a wreck, hopeless, nervous, and moving away. I should've been there for you and still should be. I'm sorry.  You know how I get sometimes; I shut down. I promise, I love you.</p>

							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Are you still thinking about keeping the baby? I'm not insinuating anything. It's just that two months is a long time, and you're decisive, sometimes impulsive.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">If you are, are you still drinking? You shouldn't be. The baby might come out wrong.</p>

							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Me? I've been better. I guess I just don't know that I'm myself here, or who I am in general. It isn't that I'm lonely, at least not in the traditional definition—I've gotten drinks with some co-workers a couple of times, but I don't know that anyone here understands me or wants to. I'm alone in my head, and it's a scary place to be.</p>

							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Me, a father. Can you imagine? I hope so.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I need you. I love you. I'll come back and spend the rest of my life with you, if that's what you want.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Please write back.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orv—</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Unreplied, this letter has been stowed away, carefully hidden but not forgotten inside a copy of the Lutheran Hymnal in a desk drawer in the Dandy-Atters' guest bedroom.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">It's been six years.</p>

						<!--This is a break in the story-->
						<p class="h3 px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>

	 					<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Forest Meadows is a slice of suburbia in transition. In the last quarter of the twentieth-century, dozens of middle-class families and one city councilman lived in up-kept two-story houses. Their deep lawns were watered daily, maintained by hired lawn services or shirtless fathers. Bricked, cylinder mailboxes the size of cookie monsters hinting at aspiring affluence.</p>
	 					
	 					<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">But now, just a two decades later, with the ghetto encroaching into the township, lower-middle class families settle for cracked and beaten sidewalks, lawns patched with crab-grass and dandelions, missing-shingled roofs, and year-round Christmas lights to avoid seasonal effort.</p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville Alberts bicycles north on the neighborhood's winding street.  The leaves in the trees are boasting bold shades in the chill autumn air: orange, red, and brown. He turns down a cul-de-sac, one of many that spread away from main street and brakes at an overgrown rose bush and uses long nails to pinch off one wilting bud.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A Google-searched, hyphenated last name and address, a Craig's List advertisement, and a mixture of hope, curiosity, and desperation has brought him to Dolores's yard.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">After all these years, he'd been surprised to find her still in Rackle, the city a 45-minute drive from the rural town they'd grown up in. She'd always dreamt big about the world outside of the Midwest and wanting to go and be a part of it, change it. A journalist without motive. But life and pregnancy has a way of changing expectations.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He stuffs the flower, thorns and all, into the breast pocket of his fitted button-down and walks his bike up her cracked driveway.</p>

						<!--This is a break in the story-->
						<p class="h3 px2 center h2">· · ·</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“You know who I bumped into at that little art fair in Emdly last weekend?”</span> Dolores Dandy-Atter asks her husband, interrupting his concentration. He is pouring a full bottle of Crown Royal into an empty one of Pappy Van Winkle, thinking just like that, this whiskey ages fourteen years.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The bottle's only half-full when he spills.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“God damn it, Dolores! Couldn't you just shut up for thirty-fucking-seconds? Fuck.  It's on the carpet.”</span>  

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores doesn't look up from the little Sudoku booklet she is filling out with a blue-ink pen that she twirls through the fingers of her left hand.  Her legs tumble from underneath her down the couch. She realizes he should be using a funnel.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Maggy Hooper, from the TV,”</span> she says now. Her husband's speed drying the blue carpet with a dish rag and fast, vertical back-and-forths.  <span class="dialogue">“Imagine me,”</span> she elaborates, almost dreamily.  <span class="dialogue">“walking with no particular direction through the little tents looking at hand-made jewelry and cutesy, out-of-place, midsummer knitted caps.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She pauses, sighs. <span class="dialogue">“I stepped into a tent just brimming with oil paintings of sail boats—in storms, tied at the dock, with people—a captain maybe, tons of things.  And there she was, Maggy Hooper, to my right, peacock hair and all.”</span>   None of what she's said had actually happened. Dolores’s lying and biting the skin on the inside of her mouth.</p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Who's Maggy Hooper?”</span> her husband replies, uninterestedly tickling the conversation's belly.  He is back standing, bottle over bottle, acting with a NO-MAN-FAILS-TWICE mentality.  But between his split concentration of his wife's chirping, the pouring, a constant uninvited sorrowing at his sexless marriage, and the ring of the door bell, he overloads, spills for a second time. He should've used a funnel, he realizes.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“God damn it! Can you give a guy a fucking break? Sixty-fucking seconds! That's all I'm askin'—.”</span></p> 
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Indignant, Dolores closes her book and crosses her arms over her chest, for a second silent, but then says, <span class="dialogue">“get yourself cleaned up and throw that rag in the laundry, and I'll see who's at the door.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She's patient with him for the sake their daughter, though in honesty, she struggles with despise and regret. After blowing an empty kiss, she strides from the living room.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">When Dolores opens the front door, she's startled to see a man whose girlish grin looks distantly familiar to her.  He is holding a <span class="fancy h2">FOR SALE by owner</span> sign with the Dandy-Atter phone number written on it. The man's tight Khakis are brown, his shirt white with blue checkers. In a moment of social confusion, he runs his fingers through the thick, groomed beard that dominates his face.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Hi.”</span> His voice, albeit chipper, is withdrawn, nervous. <span class="dialogue">“My name's Orville Alberts, and I might be interested in your sailboat here.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He feels fluttery, real funny, but maintains his composure.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores, however, flushes red with recognition and disbelief, partially out of fear, and entirely humiliated by the immediacy of the encounter.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“One second. Sorry!”</span> Dolores closes the door hard and spins around like an actress in a movie. <span class="dialogue">“Roland, sweetheart, there's a man here who says he might be interested in the boat!”</span></p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What time is it? At this hour?”</span> He asks, strolling over. He's changed into a pair of less-sticky blue jeans and a cotton sweater that makes him look porky.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores opens the door again. The man's grin has disappeared, but seems no less the friendly sailboat buyer.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="thought-dialogue">What did he think, he could just come to my house and steal me away? After all this time, why?</span> She can't help but acknowledge an upside-downness to her stomach resembling a rare moment of marital excitement.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Mr. Alberts, come in, come in. You must be freezing. It must be freezing out there. And they call this late-September,”</span> Roland bellows. Roland's a plumber by trade, but in this moment resembles more closely a used car salesman.  

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville steps deliberately through the door frame, rubbing his chapped hands together, adjusting.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Let me take that coat of yours,”</span> Dolores says tersely, trying to sound normal.  

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville pulls off his brown, summer windbreaker in one motion, handing it to Dolores. Their fingers brush, faintly and longingly.  He pulls a late-bloom, red rose from his breast pocket and sniffs it, before returning it to its pocket and placing his hand on his forehead and sweeping downward across his face.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I could come back if this isn't a good time?”</span> Orville offers.</p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores laughs, then answers. <span class="dialogue">“Who us? This neighborhood? It never sleeps.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">This is no exaggeration. Forest Meadows is full of meticulous retired Protestants.  <span class="thought-dialogue">Oh, welcome to the neighborhood,</span> they'd greeted her, <span class="thought-dialogue">Well, aren't those just lovely tattoos.  We baked you a pie.</span> She wouldn't be surprised if they came rapping on her door the next day and telling her with high pretentiousness how they'd all observed a beautiful, young homeless man wandering around at this hour and were wondering whether she didn't know something about that.  

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Let's sit. Care for anything to drink? Roland, honey, go fetch a tray, will you?”</span> Dolores isn't sure if he hears her.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“So Orv, can I call you Orv?“</span> Roland asks.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Orville's fine.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Okay, <span class="italics">Orville,</span>  tell me. How did you hear about my Cape Dorey?”</span></p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m
						 lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Craig's List.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Oh, right, right.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Really, <span class="italics">Roland.</span> Where are our manners? Go fetch a tray,”</span> Dolores says. Roland nods and disappears through a door to the kitchen.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville says something incomprehensible but polite, and he steps slowly from the stain-wooded vestibule into the living room in response to the either nudging or comforting palm on the small of his back.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I've missed you,”</span>Orville whispers.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Not so loud,”</span> Dolores whispers back, and then admits loudly, <span class="dialogue">“Thank you so much! But we don't even use it often—the fireplace!”</span> She sits sprawled barefoot on the custard-coloured sofa.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Instead of sitting, Orville wanders to a bookshelf on the far side of the room, keeping his back mostly to Dolores, examining a painting of a little girl with blue eyes and a matching dress holding her hands over her ears.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Aren't you you l-lonely?”</span> Orville stammers.</p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“He we are!”</span> Roland reemerges, balancing on his hand a silver serving tray holding two empty cocktail shooters and a round-bottomed red-filled wine glass—Dolores's second, which he sets on the same side table as an expensive whiskey bottle. <span class="dialogue">“Orville Alberts! A pleasure, all mine, I'm tellin’ yah.”</span> Roland's voice carries as if he's trying to communicate a matter-of-fact seriousness, and he's sticking out his right hand to shake a second time.  <span class="dialogue">“So back to business. My Cape Dorey, yeah? She's a beaut, really something. All original finish. It'll break my heart to have to see her go, but we got ridda the barn, and now don't have a place to store her over the winter. Mmhmm,”</span> he says. Orville catches Dolores's rolling eyes.  <span class="dialogue">“Just one spider-crack on the stern,”</span> Roland concludes. His eye twitches indiscriminately, a shy, lazy eye hiding behind the lenses of his glasses.  <span class="dialogue">“Business, excuse me. Where're my manners? A whiskey? Single malt from the Irish Isles—”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Just water's fine, thanks.”</span> Orville observes critically his shoes, fully tied.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Roland nods, walking curiously to the kitchen muttering, <span class="dialogue">“What kind of sailor prefers water over whiskey?”</span></p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">When her husband was outside the room, Dolores asks, <span class="dialogue">“What do you mean <span class="thought-dialogue">'Am I lonely,'</span> Orville? I haven't even heard from you in years, and you just show up one day, Orville?”</span> She is sitting with her legs bent near her chest.  Her hands clutch her wine, and she takes a quick, frustrated sip.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“You're the one who never responded to any of my letters!”</span> Orville accuses.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“So what! You should've came anyway! You would've if you'd actually loved me...”</span> Dolores says. In her voice is hurt and long-repressed frustration.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville turns and examines her face for first time since he'd arrived. Touch-up tries, albeit with partial success, to mask the bags and crows' feet.  Her face is thin and tight, and her eyebrows are neatly trimmed, auburn, matching her hair, which is straggly and sprinkled with grey.  Her belled pants also match her hair colour, though a shade or two darker.  She might've been beautiful once, and maybe even still could be now, but for the stretched, decaying sleeves of tattoos that cover her arms.</p>  

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="thought-dialogue">“'Am I lonely?'</span> <span class="dialogue">Orv, I have a family, I mean—.”</span></p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">That's when he notices a little girl in denim overalls standing in the corner of the room wearing a cream-coloured lampshade over her head. Her pigtails hang shoulder length, and her hands tumble Jango with a knotty piece of ruby-coloured yarn.  She giggles in the stupefied silence, overly cognizant of an atmospheric discomfort.  It is vivid and romantic to Orville not to have yet noticed this pigtailed daughter slash room fixture.</p> 

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Ainsley, come to Mommy now, please,”</span> Dolores commands.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The child, pulling off the lampshade and setting it delicately on the floor, looks at Orville. <span class="dialogue">“Lellow Horsecream!”</span> she cries excitedly and skitters over to the couch, sitting cross-legged Indian-styled on the floor.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores, taking another sip and setting her glass down, begins playing Piggly Wiggly with her fingers through her daughter's hair.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville lallops speechless over to the adjacent sofa. He is mystified. The long-imagined child. The reason for their breakup. Not his, she'd told him. Wondering whether the child is a simpleton or a prodigy, Orville pours himself a glass of whiskey and swallows the antidote whole. He can't stop staring at the face of this child, Ainsley Klair Dandy-Atter. Such innocence. Befuddled, he clenches the arm of the sofa.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“And a water for the—Oh.  Fancied a whiskey after all? I should say—”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Excuse me, Mr. Dandy-Atter, but could I, uh, u-use your b-bathroom?”</span> Orville asks.</p> 
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Down the hall on your left.”</span> Roland responds. He feels duped and after Orville stumbles away says, <span class="dialogue">“Dolores, Love, what happened? Is he crying? I think I hear him crying.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Down the hall, a door slams.</p> 
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Roland sits down on the vacant couch and pours himself a shot, gulps it down, and pours a second.  First, Dolores curls her lower lip inward on top of her middle teeth, a nervous habit since braces.  Then she takes a long sip of her wine, luxuriating in the taste. There is a conversational void, and instead of the adults', it's Ainsley's voice that fills it.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Mommy, how do you know that man?”</span></p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores does her best to control her surprise, but blushes slightly. She turns to Roland, confuses her face, and shrugs her left shoulder nonchalantly.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What'ya mean pumpkin? I don't know him,”</span> she says.</p>

						<!--This is a break in the story-->
						<p class="h3 px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville slams the door too hard, he realizes. Not giving a damn.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">On the immediate left is a marble basin.  He grasps and leans his weight on it while searching feverishly for rationality in his mirrored reflection.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="thought-dialogue">A daughter? A daughter. My daughter?</span> Orville splashes water on his face, breathing hard and becoming light headed.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He finds comfort on a nearby ceramic toilet seat. His head is between his legs. The room is spinning.  He uses his right hand to tear away bath tissue. Rubbing his cheek, drying the rush of tears.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He reaches into his pocket unabashed for the pill bottle. Push twist. Tilt. One blue, two whites. Tongue and water. Swallow. He sits on the floor leaning against the bathtub. Panting with blurred vision, he imagines the words Raise High the <span class="fancy">Roof Beam, Carpenter!</span> written in lipstick on the mirror above the sink.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="thought-dialogue">Look at him. No wonder nobody loves him, the useless piece of shit.</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville is thinking about Ainsley. <span class="thought-dialogue">How old is she? What does she like? What does she not like?</span> He tries to think back to his own childhood, but it's too long ago. And all that comes to mind is the colour red, as in blood, and things that he's long repressed. He remembers why he'd freaked out and left Dolores, young and pregnant.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="thought-dialogue">It's not your's,</span> she'd said, but he knew she was lying with thick skin trying to protect herself. He could always tell when she was lying because when she lied she used to gnaw on the skin on the inside of her mouth. 

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">And he remembered not telling her he knew she was lying.</p> 

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">And he remembered moving away two days later because that was planned before either of them knew she was pregnant.</p> 

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">And he remembered how the barrier of distance empowered him to write love letters and apologizes, because they were empty and wouldn't make any difference because he'd never have the courage to return to Rackle.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville couldn't have been a father then because he hadn't been ready. And he still can't because he's still not ready, but he's here now. He's impulsive and unstable.  All he can think about is Dolores.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A habit of motion, his fingers find a cigarette, and a spark is never far behind.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">By this time, several minutes had past.  Ainsley has wandered away from her mother and the sofa and is somersaulting in the corner. Roland is worried, but clueless. After all, he was much too rational to believe a five-year-old's pretense that his wife was previously acquainted with the stranger who is currently crying in their bathroom. Dolores is worried because she lacks control over the situation.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Mom! Watch. Mom!”</span>Ainsley sings playfully. <span class="dialogue">“I'm a rolie-polie-olie!”</span> she says, meaning a pill bug.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“That's lovely, Pumpkin. Really,”</span> Dolores says.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Should we go in and check on him? It's been what, 10 minutes? More?”</span> Roland asks. He's panicking in his usual way. His primary concern is that he's liable if something were to happen. <span class="dialogue">“Maybe he needs a doctor.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“He's fine.  I mean, I'm sure—well, actually I don't really know, but it probably has something to do with the boat sale still, right? A hesitant buyer making a calculated decision?”</span> Dolores presumes. She passively waves her wrist, indicating nothing. 

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She fumbles with the silk fabric of her white blouse. <span class="dialogue">“I'll go check on him. You stay here,”</span> she says to Roland.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Before he can respond, she stands up, then calls in her daughter's direction.  <span class="dialogue">“Ainsley, honey. Aren't you just darling? Sweetheart, pay attention. Mommy's speaking.”</span> Ainsley perks up. <span class="dialogue">“It's past your bedtime.”</span> After brief consideration, Ainsley slinks to her mother's side.  They turn the corner down the hall.</p>
						
						<!--This is a break in the story-->
						<p class="h3 px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Orville?”</span> Dolores raps sympathetically on the bathroom door. <span class="dialogue">“You okay?”</span> she asks. Ainsley clings to her mother's other hand.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I think he's crying,</span> Ainsley whispers.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">More silence.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Let's put you in bed.”</span> Dolores says. Her knuckles knock twice more in quick succession.  <span class="dialogue">“I'll be back in a minute, okay?”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Mother and daughter continue to daughter's room, pink, where Ainsley strips and dons polka dot jammies, pink, while Dolores parachute-spreads the jumble of sheets and quilts, pink.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Ainsley climbs under the covers, which her mother tucks under the mattress. They lean to kiss cheeks. At the light switch, Dolores pauses customarily.  <span class="dialogue">“Sweet dreams, Ainsley.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Mom, wait.”</span> Ainsley sits up.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores sighs through her teeth because there’re more pressing matters.  She's never liked it when Orville acted this way, locking himself up, feeling 'funny'—all that.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Orville.”</span> Ainsley continues. <span class="dialogue">“Why is he crying? How <span class="emphasis">do</span> you know him?”</span> Her voice is mellow, considerate.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Dolores thinks for a second. <span class="dialogue">“I'll tell you when you're older, okay? Goodnight, Love.” </span>Dolores clicks the light off and shuts the door behind her.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She is almost to the bathroom door when a smoke alarm blares.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Shit,”</span> she says disdainfully, and the door unlocks, swinging inward.  A billow of smoke, steam and a nose-wiping, snuffling Orville Alberts emerges. The shower hasn't been turned off.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He looks at Dolores. His look is earnest, filled with embarrassment and hurt.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I'm fine,”</span> he says.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Orville, what the hell has happened to you? What the hell's happening?”</span></p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I should go—I never should've come.”</span> He pushes at the carpet with the toe of his right shoe.</p>
					
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“What's this even about?”</span> she asks.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“I should go.”</span> Orville turns and walks the way he'd come. Roland, drink in hand, feelin' it, is fast approaching.</p> 
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“The fuck's goin on?”</span> He thunders. Orville walks passed unabated. Roland stops, pivots, and grabs Orville by the shoulder. <span class="dialogue">“The fuck're you doin’?”</span>
	 
	 					<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Roland, could you just handle the alarm?”</span> Dolores encourages. Her voice calm, but forthright.<span class="dialogue">“I'm just going to see Mr. Alberts out.”</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“And is that drugs I smell?”</span> Roland accuses. He's pissed, but when he looks at Dolores and sees that glare in her eyes, the one that says <span class="thought-dialogue">'you better fucking listen to me,'</span>  he lets go of Orville's shoulder and cooperates.</p>
 						
 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville rushes to get his coat, is reaching for the doorknob, but Dolores grabs it first.</p>
 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Pausing.</p> 

 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“We'll talk, okay? Hey,”</span> she says. Orville is downcast. She bumps up his chin with her knuckles. <span class="dialogue">“Look at me.”</span> Orville looks at her.  His eyes are swollen from crying, he smells of cigarette smoke, and his gaze is distant. Understanding through paralysis. Often times in life, there's nothing you can do.</p> 
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“We'll talk, OK?”</span> Dolores repeats. Orville nods. She pulls the door inward, and Orville steps out.  <span class="dialogue">“Goodnight, Orville.”</span>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Dolores,”</span> Orville says. <span class="diaglogue">“She's my daughter too.”</span> He's once more on the verge of tears, outcast. Her grin is steady, empathetic.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">“Since when, Orville?”</span> she says. <span class="dialogue">“Take care of yourself.” Dolores closes the door.</span></p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The sun had set, though it is not altogether late. The air is heavy with the smell of a looming rain, bounding to bursting. Cold has set in along with a wet stillness that can get inside of a lonely soul and fuck with it.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Thunder cracks.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Orville half-walks, half-stumbles along the curved, cement path leading to the driveway where he's faced with option: Left, down the driveway and onto the rest of his life, or right, to where a patch of shadow veils the Cape Dory.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">It is in this moment, turning right, that Orville, for the first time, actually considers buying the sailboat, spider-crack and all.</p>
