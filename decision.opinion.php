					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">Even though media have changed greatly over the past three decades, the psychological heuristics humans use to validate information as true and reliable have remained static. Heuristics, automatic associative processes to make sense of incoming information based on previous experiences, face new challenges in our connected world.  As a result, we experience novel, unintended, and non-obvious shortcomings in our ability to sift information.  Through this major, I will better understand how patterns of Internet media capture consumer attention by curating shared experiences, specifically through algorithmic filtering by companies and through citizen journaling by bloggers and social media users. Through a psychological lens, I will be able to consider the processes by which Internet media influences user trust. Using creative writing, I will learn how well-structured stories affect our perception of truth. Finally, through information science, I will understand methodology behind how industry professionals both create and interrogate digital environments. This body of knowledge and the corresponding thesis project will help me answer questions I have about the ramifications on human behavior the transition into the Conceptual Age1 and, more specifically, modern, divergent media are having. Specifically, how do content generators: bloggers, journalists, and social media users, and how do information architects: web designers, search engine companies, and news portal companies go about differing from one another and attracting maximum user attention?</p> 
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">Imagine Steven and Sarah, two friends who, although neither knows very much about the topic, are discussing the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Steven is arguing that the U.S. and its allies should not only continue to offer support to Israel, but increase the amount of aid given in order to fuel democracy in the region. His argument is based on an article he found on Reddit. Sarah, on the other hand, has sympathy for Palestine that is based on emotionally-charged comments about alleged atrocities committed by Israel posted by her friends on Facebook. Objectively, the conflict in question is very complex, having profound influence on the lives of millions. Accordingly, it may seem peculiar that Steven and Sarah have such strong opinions even though neither has researched the issue very thoroughly.</p>
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">Humans leverage prior knowledge to contextualize social information from our environment, a process known as schema formation.  Schemas benefit our constant story sharing, helping us to form expectations about situations, while facilitating quicker judgments and improving the encoding and retention mechanisms of memory. Although the anecdote above is hyperbolic, it highlights our reliance on schemas, which, like recall, anchoring, and representativeness heuristics, sometimes lead us to make false inferences resulting in ineffective decisions and shallow opinions. In the example above, Stephen has been influenced by the apparent approval of others and the journalist's ability to convey a story.  The stories affecting Sarah's opinion-processes were curated by her non-professional, personal network, though psychologically-identical heuristics brought her to her conclusions.</p>
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">Consider possible motives and consequences of biased digital information curation-decisions. In the twentieth century, television and radio standardized potential information sources.  People were limited in their choice of content, and, as a result, had little agency in seeking perhaps more reliable alternatives. Stated differently, those who controlled the media sources were able to direct consumer attention.  With the Internet, acquisition of information has become an altogether more personal process.  We Google.  We use Wikipedia.  We use news portals, social media sites, and apps that we have selected from hundreds of possibilities. We're exposed to vast sources of information, but as the number of possibilities increases, differentiating in terms of legitimacy or quality becomes a more strenuous process. Because of a bias towards convenience, haphazard inferences unintentionally influence perceptions of current events and popular culture, as well as undermine the responsible judgments we would like to be making as consumers.</p> 
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">Companies are trending towards sophisticated relevancy algorithms to personalize Internet experiences that reflect our various upbringings with different privileges, beliefs, passions, and dreams. For example, Google News tailors a customizable news feed, prioritizing output based on patterns of previous behavior. The basic philosophy is that because not all news is relevant to us, the news that isn't should be buried away where we might not find it. Initially, this system appears to be a win-win. Users are systematically exposed to desired information; Google garners marketable user-attention to sell to other companies. However, relevancy doesn't equate to reliability, and personalized filtering of Internet content doesn't surmount the issues of choice, but instead creates a 'Filter Bubble,' which experts argue reinforces our personal ideologies without facilitating cross-examination of our opinions (Palister, 2012).</p>
 					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">Alternatives to algorithmically sorted content include collective validation methods, such as the up-vote/down-vote system on Reddit, where non-professional posters are able to play bigger roles in the curation of supposedly trustworthy news. Initially, this too seems practical. If this many people have read and agreed with this article, it must be truthful. However, Weniger et al. present evidence that within any given popular-subreddit post, only a few significant second-hand commenters' contributions direct the conversation. Casual, convenience-biased users, who might not actually not have the time or motivation to read the article could be considered influenced disproportionately by relatively few, potentially-biased influencers: the posters who summarize the content of an article in a title, the number of anonymous up-votes, the few significant second-hand commenters, and the moderators behind the curtain. From this perspective, one might argue that collective validation on Reddit actuates Tversky's Law of Small Numbers, where isolated pockets of Reddit users' “intuitive expectations are governed by a consistent misperception of the world” (Tversky, 1971)	
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">To avoid blind adherence to personalized algorithms and collective-validation, a reasonable individual will read the news article herself, weigh the arguments of the journalist against her own experiences and values, and carefully decide whether to accept or reject the content. As humans, however, we are not always as logical as we'd like to be, especially because many times our experiences and values are subjective and personal. In his book, A Whole New Mind, Daniel Pink argues that “as facts become...widely available and instantly accessible,...what begins to matter more is the ability to place facts in context and to deliver them with emotional impact” (Pink, 2005). This suggests that journalists who have the professional freedom may benefit through their use of stories, and that users of social media sites and collectively validated sites may be disproportionately influenced by the ability of content generators to string together convincing narratives. This major uses creative writing as a platform to learn how to structure compelling stories, leveraging symbol, association and metaphor to elicit emotional responses and trust from a reader or audience, and a potential independent study with a poet or author in English department would allow for a semester focus on the nuances of story-telling and poetic elements that persist in media.</p> 
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">With skills and tools learned through classes offered at the School of Information, a thesis could expand upon the body of knowledge described here. If I were to conduct the thesis today, I would leverage eye-tracking technology and subjective, survey methodology to measure possible correlation between attention and user-trust. Ethnographically, this research could examine the how long-term exposure to news platforms like Google News and Reddit affects University students’ perceptions of world news events. Moreover, pupil dilation measurements could objectively quantify the emotional effect of journalized stories (Duchowski, 2007), which could be correlated with the subjective perception of trustworthiness. 
					<p class="f4-m lh-copy mw6">In conclusion, prior knowledge helps us to categorize information into memory for later retrieval. We automatically compare this base of knowledge to incoming information, facilitating subjective predictions as to the validity of information. However, the processes behind information curation are disparate, and truth is but one motivation driving the information curation process among attention dominance, user-reputation, or monetary marketing prowess.  The curriculum proposed here offers insight not only into the mechanisms of media, but how humans are psychologically making sense of modern media, and how content generators use story-telling skills, as Don Norman puts it, to “encapsulate into one compact package: information, knowledge, context, and emotion” (Norman, 1993).
