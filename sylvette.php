					<div class="lg-col lg-col-9">
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Parling Abaster is resting on St. Petri's stone foresteps.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">His wood cane is balanced between his legs.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">To his left sit three beautiful women speaking French, their legs all a'tangle amidst smiles and intimate laughter.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">An apple red bicycle rides by, its bell <span class="dialogue">tinging.</span></p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">An empty plastic grocery tote is carried by the ebb of the wind and smashes into the face of one of the church's envious gargoyles.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">A woman in a wine-colored cloche strolls up the street in a sweepy, simple black dress that hangs to her knees and flows all around her.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Round rimmed glasses shade her eyes from the evening sun. Powdered pale, her face contrasts her stark, ruby lips.  She is wearing one glove on her left hand.
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2"><span class="dialogue">Where is the other glove?</span> Parling wonders, then scans the path behind her. <span class="dialogue">There!</span></p> 
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Lying on the cobblestone was the other glove.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He stands up and hobbles down the steps in the direction of the glove and the woman.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Miss, excuse me, miss!</span> Parling calls, but the woman was already to the street corner, waiting for traffic.</p>
  
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">With sudden determination, Parling decides to follow. And as he begins the chase, Parling's legs find new strength, transforming into what they had been in youth.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">His stride are long and easy, his pace comfortable. He looks down and is amazed to see his usual white arm hair becoming darker, thicker right before his eyes. Parling realizes this good omen.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">I am growing younger! I must speak to this woman in the cloche.</span></p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">No longer needing his cane, he drops it on the street like dead weight out the side of a boat.</p> 
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">The woman turns right, heading in the direction of the of the old fishermen's quarter.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Now lined with little bakeries, markets, and pubs, she seems to be walking without light-blueose, pausing here and there to peek into shop windows.</p>  
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Parling sees her pause to light a cigarette.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He is confident he'll soon overtake her and  wonders what he'll say.</p> 
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 dialogue red">What he might say 1</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 dialogue red">What he might say 2</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 dialogue red">What he might say 3</p>
	
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">She holds her cigarette in her left, ungloved, hand, and as she flicks the ash she looks over her shoulder. Her eyes meet Parling's, and she smiles.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2"><span class="dialogue">Yes, I've got her attention!</span></p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Parling slows his stride and waves the glove in the air. But the woman doesn't notice. Even though she looking in his direction, she doesn't see him; she is looking <span class="dialogue">past</span> him.</p>
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Miss, miss, I found your missing glove!</span> he calls, but she doesn't hear him either. The woman turns forward and continues walking into the wharf.</p>
 	
 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Parling follows, surprised but determined. After all, he isn't so far behind now, and this it feels like everything thus far in his life has led him to this one, exciting moment.</p>

 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 red">He is so close.  But she turns a corner before he can reach out. And as he turns the corner, she vanishes.</p>

 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Suddenly, his body feels heavy, weak. An ivy greed vignette clouds his vision. Pain crawls up his spine like spiders. Aging all those years before he could even think about it, he sighs.</p>

 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">On the right is an pub, and he walks inside.</p>
						<!--This is a break in the flash-->
						<p class="h3 px2 h2 center">· · ·</p>

						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A man with white, neatly combed hair sits straight-backed in a table made for two.  He wears a fitted, navy blue jacket over a clean, bleached shirt, buttoned to the top.  In the center of the table is a half-burnt candle flickering through the gentle June breeze that slides in through the open roof.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Also on the table are a rectangular matchbox, a carved, walnut smoking pipe, its corresponding ashtray, a blanketed bottle of 2000 Montalcino red, and, directly across the table, a small antique picture frame containing a black and white photograph of a beautiful woman holding a cigarette, laughing.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Next to the photograph sits a filled, untouched wine glass.  The man takes up his own glass and tips it subtly towards the frame.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Honest Syl, I don't know how I'd even live without you.</span>  The clitter of other partisans' drowns the confession into a whisper.  He raps the neck of the pipe to clear its tarred contents and pulls a thin cardboard tobacco box from a pocket in his jacket.  Carefully, he pinches some snuff into the bowl.  Pulling open his matchbox, he pines over which match to strike, then dips the fire to the leaf and inhales in short breaths until a ring snorts though the bowl and rises into the humid summery air.</p> 
  
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He looks around.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 red">The pub resembles a dainty, well-organized broom cupboard complete with an olive colored aluminum roof, which protects the eastward half from rain's drear.   Near the precipice of open space, plays a pianist Clair de Lune.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 red">The westside of the pub is a half-stair-loft, and is roofed by romantic, French umbrellas.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 red">On the south end of the loft, is a room corked with still, aging wine bottles.  The space as a whole eludes a criquety, red demure, that could only be more antique and lucid either love-stained or filled with mystique, tobacco air, a responsibility Parling Abaster and his ageless, laughing mistress silently partake in.</p>
  
 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">A young couple sit at a table nearby.  The man's black loose-leaf hair plays small-trampoline as he leans over the table, push his lover's hair behind her left ear, and whisper something</p>

 						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The woman giggles to disguise a blush that cannot be disguised, and unweaves her interlocked fingers to reach across and apply a compassionate pressure to his palm.</p> 
  
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">An understanding smile breaches Parling's cracking lips as he stares at the young lovers.  His eyes are tired and sad from after all he's been through.</p>
						
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He remembers: the look, the touch, the feeling.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">He raps the neck of the pipe to clear again its tarred contents and pinches more snuff into his pipe, which he strikes and sighs, medicating now with the blissful sight of the laughing, youthful eyes, the silky, curved lips, the sculpted narrow brow, the delicate, photographed symmetry...</p>
 
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Honestly, Syllvette. How could I ever live without you?</span>  He nods his head to dialogue only he can hear, then chuckles.  <span class="dialogue">I'd have to carry you in my jacket pocket and order us fine wine.  And you'd be there with me still.  And we'd be happy, even then.</span></p>
  
						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Overcome with a sense of enchantment I can't describe, I'm lifted to my feet. I am walking with delicate steps, carried by the still beauty of a moment to the side of the man who is in this world entirely alone.</p>

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 red">I lean down and kiss his right cheek, and as I brush my lips across his ear, I whisper something only he knows.</p> 

						<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">All this time, his eyes never depart those of his last, lost love, and tears find their way down his cheeks, finally understanding.</p>
