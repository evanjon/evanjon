					<div class="lg-col lg-col-9">
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 serif">FOUR CHILDREN are huddling in the far corner of the playground.  I am one of them.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Today is Wednesday, that means the upper-graders have recess Spanish class. Otherwise, they'd be here.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f3-m lh-copy mw7">This corner's where they trade Pokémon, where the ivy grows on the rusty dugout and blocks you from the teacher's line of sight.  Where the neighbor’s dog is chained nearby, barking and growling.  It’s here where Betty Rowwy slipped and bit her lip and Billy Grier was bullied into eating peanut butter.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">This is the bad corner of the playground, and now's our time.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">Brim, Cici, Ainsley, and Jaret.  Those are our names.  Jaret and Brim are my best friends. You can tell because we share each other’s socks.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">My pants are ripped.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I'm holding my hands behind my back because it is not my turn.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The other children are looking at Cici’s Barbie dolls she is holding in her hands.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">This is art,</span> she explains even though I'm telling her flat-out she's supposed to bring something cool if you wants to be in Ekridaat.  (That's the name of our club, made from our last names).</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">But this is art,</span> Cici insists.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I shake my head, and Jaret tells her she's stupid.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">Screw Cici.  I didn't invite her; wouldn't of—.  Brim did—in love with her, he says.  Gimme a break.  </p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I'll tell you the kinda girl she is. She's exactly the kind who wears only pink and throws tantrums in McDonald's. The kind that thinks she's smarter than me. The kind whose mom my mom thinks has a big butt. She screams and giggles in the same breath, and sometimes brings cupcakes to class.  Last year, when I was her Secret Santa, I made her a bug board, a really <span class="emphasis">cool</span> bug board. And you know what she did? Scream.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">She’s that kinda girl.</p>  
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">This is stupid,</span> Cici says pouting, arms crossed.  
							<p class="h3 px2 mt2">Jaret already went.  He brought a Swiss Army knife.  Said he'd climbed the clothes bars in his parents' closet to get it.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">The stuff he brings is usually pretty cool. Last week, he brought a pool torpedo.  The week before, a raccoon hat.  Once, he dressed up like a girl the whole day just to show us he could.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Brim tells us to shut it because it's his turn.  He pulls from his backbag a black, rubber, bowl-shaped thing.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">What is it?</span>Jaret asks.</p>
		 					<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Life art,</span> Brim answers.  <span class="dialogue">My mom collects it. You have to go into the woods and find things that other humans leave behind.  She collects rusty bits of metal and big shards of color glass and other stuff.  And then she piles it in the back yard.  I found this by a log in a meadow when I was playing Explorer yesterday.</span></p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Brim's standing broad-shouldered and proud, but I start laughing because I realize what the thing he's holding is.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">That's some old toilet plunger without its handle,</span> I tell him.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Jaret's laughing now too, and Cici's pouting even more than before.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">It is not,</span> Brim insists, but I can see it on his face he knows I'm right.  He's embarrassed.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Cici snaps at me that I <span class="dialogue">would know what it is because my dad's a plumber.</span></p> 
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I tell her, <span class="dialogue">shut up you snarky bitch. I'm happy my dad's a plumber.</span></p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Brim and Jaret are impressed and shocked that I said 'bitch.'</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Cici's wide-eyed and jaw-dropped—like it’s the first time she’s ever heard a swear before. (Not surprised).</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Brim whispers something into her ear to calm her down.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Jaret asks me what 'snarky' means, and I tell him I'm not sure exactly.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Cici brushes her red hair off her shoulder; she's on her last nerve.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">My turn.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">I'm showing them the jar I've been holding behind my back.  Pinholes are pricked into the lid to let the frog inside breathe.</p> 
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">There's this frog pond at the end of my neighborhood,</span> I explain. <span class="dialogue">Every spring, I go with my parents and scoop up tadpoles for the pond in our garden.  Good for the dirt, Dad says.  In the summer, at night, they ribbet, and I can hear them from my room.</span></p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">I snook out last night and caught one because I wanted to show you guys something.</span></p>  
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Look at her. She's huge. See those gross, green lumps on her back?  That's why I named her Spot.</span></p> 
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Cool,</span> Brim says. And even Cici’s uncrossed her arms, paying attention.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Watch,</span> I instruct.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I'm smashing the jar on the ground as hard as I can.</p> 
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Spot hops, but I'm too fast.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I stomp her.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I am stomping on her.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 h2 fancy">CRUNCH.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Dead,</span> I exclaim.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Dude,</span> Brim says. (Mom says he's the kind to get bullied in high school.)</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Cici is making awful gasping sounds and spins away because she can’t look, Her flower dress snags on the fence.  Rip.  Now you can see her butt, and Brim is asking me why I'm always doing stupid things even though his eyes are wide, blushing and staring.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Cici’s crying now.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Brim puts his arm around his shoulder.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Stop being a baby,</span> I sneer.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">God, Ainsley, she’s just a girl,</span> Brim says.</p> 
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">I am too, I wanna tell him.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">It’s no excuse, I wanna say, but I don’t say anything at all, instead just looking at the ground, kicking my shoe in the dirt.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">They start walking towards the teacher on duty, Mrs. Brompins.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Brim turns back to yell that I'm gonna get in trouble.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">I know that,</span> I say, but he isn't listening.
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">Sorry,</span> I say louder. He hears me this time and gives me a wave to let me know he'll forgive me.
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6 mt2">The bell ending recess is ringing, and I feel sad.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">These are our last few moments of Wednesday, and at some level I probably understand that things won't be the same next week.</p> 
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6">Jaret’s been quiet, just staring at the pile of mushy frog in the dirt in the bad corner of the playground.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">What do you think happens after we die,</span> he whispers.</p>
							<p class="h3 px2 f4-m lh-copy mw6"><span class="dialogue">It's a secret,</span> I whisper back.</p>
